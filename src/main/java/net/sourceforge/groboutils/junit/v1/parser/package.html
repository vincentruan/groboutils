<BODY>
The GroboUtils JUnit Extention: classes to help in the creation and
execution of JUnit tests.
<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>
    The <tt>TestClassParser</tt> combined with the <tt>TestClassCreator</tt>
    contains much of the logic that the JUnit class <tt>TestSuite</tt> contains.
    However, the parser is designed with extensibility in mind. Its sole purpose
    is to parse out test methods and create test instances.
</P>

<P>
    The <tt>TestClassParser</tt> knows how to extract the test methods from a
    test class, while <tt>TestClassCreator</tt> knows how to create test instances
    from the parsed test class.
</P>

<P>
    In order to support various means of instantiating test instances from a
    test class, the <tt>TestClassCreator</tt> depends upon instances of
    <tt>ITestCreator</tt> to perform the actual creation of the tests. The
    validation and TestSuite compilation is performed by the
    <tt>TestClassCreator</tt>.
</P>

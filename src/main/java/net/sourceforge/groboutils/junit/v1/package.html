The GroboUtils JUnit Extention: classes to help in the creation and
execution of JUnit tests.
<H3>Overview</H3>

<P>
    This package has been designed to follow the JUnit extention patterns (see
    my article in the documentation). Instead of creating direct TestCase
    subclasses to add functionality to actual TestCases, test extentions have been
    refactored for ease-of-use.
</P>

<H3>Utility Testing Classes</H3>

<P>
    The classes listed here follow the JUnit Utility Functionality pattern. They
    give more testing functionality to unit tests through a separate instance,
    rather than requiring the tests to subclass to gain the functionality.
</P>


<H4>AssertTestFactory &amp; IntegrationTestCase</H4>

<P>
    There are two kinds of "validations" a test can generate: soft and hard. A
    hard validation must be true - any inconsistency will result in the whole test
    to fail. A soft validation will still cause a test error, but the test may
    continue. Soft validations are less useful than hard validations for unit
    tests, since the point of unit tests is to make sure a small part of an
    application has the absolute correct behavior. However, for integration tests,
    this becomes less a necessity. An integration test may take great efforts
    setting up a scenario, then runs a battery of validations against the setup.
    A hard validation in these situations does not expose all the issues which
    may lie in the source.
</P>
<P>
    Hard validations are supported in JUnit with the <tt>Assert</tt> class. The
    <tt>IntegrationTestCase</tt> class in this framework allows for better support
    of soft validations by executing the soft asserts as a seperate test. This
    allows for proper reporting of the failure without stopping the flow of the
    test.
</P>

<H4>MultiThreadedTestRunner</H4>

<P>
    It can be very difficult to test code which requires inter-thread communication,
    or which may encounter synchronization problems. This class allows a TestCase
    to create runner inner classes to perform a bit of functionality for a thread,
    then pass those instances to a MultiThreadedTestRunner instance to allow them
    to run in parallel. In situations where a dead-lock may occur, a timer is
    provided which will interrupt (not kill) the running threads and report a
    failure.
